# üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Bharatiya Rescue:Missing Person Detection System! üì∏
Bharatiya Rescue is an innovative project aimed at leveraging cutting-edge technology to help reunite missing individuals with their loved ones. Our user-friendly system, built using Django, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, OpenCV, and the `facerecognition` library, combines a smooth UI with robust functionality to ensure an efficient and seamless experience for all users.

## How It Works
1. **Register a missing person complaint** with essential details like a recent photograph, name, address, Aadhar number, email, and mobile number.
2. **Surveillance mode**: The system uses facial recognition to detect the missing person's face. If a match is found, an email alert is automatically sent to the parents and the police.
3. **Location storage**: The system stores the missing person's last known location in a secure database.
4. **Admin management**: Admins can remove entries when the missing person is found, maintaining an up-to-date and efficient system.

## Future Enhancements
- Integration with advanced AI algorithms and machine learning models for improved face recognition accuracy.
- Use of geospatial technology for real-time tracking.
- Integration with social media and public alert systems to increase community response.
- Collaboration with law enforcement and technology innovators for continuous improvements.
